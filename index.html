            "Surgeon Dr. Sanduk Ruit revolutionizing cataract surgery gives
            sight to thousands", 2018 feature story by Miranda Wood on The Daily
            Telegraph
          </li>
          <li>
            A 2006 National Geographic documentary Inside North Korea documented
            not only Ruit's surgery in the highly controlled country but also
            the resulting overt adulation by the patients given to the
            then-Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Kim
            Jong-il
          </li>
          <li>
            Ruit's work in Nepal featured in Episode 5 (Mountains , Life in Thin
            Air) of the 2010 BBC documentary series Human Planet. Out of the
            Darkness, a 2011 film by Italian director Stefano Levi, documents
            Ruit's work in remote Northern Nepal.

          <li>
            In 2015, Ruit and his work featured in a New York Times op-ed by
            Nicholas Kristof: "In 5 Minutes, He Lets the Blind See". The article
            was based on reporting in Nepal by Kristof and Austin Meyer, a
            graduate journalism student at Stanford University, during the trip
            with the winner of the 2015 New York Times Win a Trip with Nick
            Kristof contest.
